# 4. Application Implementation

## 4.1	Data Donation Platform (DDP)
The Data Donation Platform was developed as a web application using React.js for the frontend along with Bootstrap library for the User Interface, which provides a clear and simple design framework. For the backend, the platform uses Supabase, an open-source backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform to handle file storage. For Supabase, the free version of this tool is used, which comes with some restrictions like limiting to 1GB of file storage (Supabase). However, researchers that want to use the DDP are encouraged to choose their preferred storage solution and modify the code to fit the new tool.
